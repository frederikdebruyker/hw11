# hw11 - Web Visualization Dashboard
## Remarks
The instructions call for:
- speed vs temp: I assume this is an error as all screenshots point to lattitude versus X;
- your first name of the site: I am not sure what is meant here: my first name, or the web site name. I left 'Lattitude' in line with given screenshots;
- glyphicons: these are no longer part of bootstrap since version 4. I have inserted an alternative;
- footer: I assume this was inserted as part of company materials, and therefore I did not insert a footer;
- images: provided images uses as I think using my own from previous exercises (and resizing etc) does not add to what I believe is the goal of this homework;

Note:
- added References section
- considered having one generic navigation 'include' so it would not have to be repeated. I understand that this should be possible with SHTML and/or JS but as we have not gone through this, neither option was retained. I left the headerTemplate.jsp file in for reference.
